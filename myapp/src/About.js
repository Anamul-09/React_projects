      <p>In the 53rd convocation of Dhaka University, president and chancellor of the University Abdul Hamid said, respect of teachers is gradually shrinking due to the actions of some vice-chancellors and teachers. He also criticised the trend of appointing the children and relatives of some vice-chancellors to universities.

We do not need to listen to the president's convocation speech to understand the condition of universities. Almost all media, including Prothom Alo, have been carrying reports about the irregularities, corruption and arbitrariness of various public university vice-chancellors.</p>
